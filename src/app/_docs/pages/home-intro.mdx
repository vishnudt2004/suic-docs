## 🧠 Not a Full Library — A Personal Collection

This isn’t a full-blown UI library with every component you'd expect. It’s a personal, curated collection of **unique, reusable, and creative components** — not meant to cover every use case, but to offer something **beautiful and different**.

---

## 📦 Install Only What You Need

There’s no single package install — and that’s intentional. You can **install individual components** using the CLI published on npm.

The **entire project** — including the website and components — lives in a single repository.

---

## 🎨 Fully Customizable, Zero Lock-in

No strict styles, no forced patterns. These components are meant to be **copied, tweaked, and transformed** however you like.

Most of them support **configurable props and CSS variables**, giving you flexibility out of the box.

---

## 📖 Every Component is Documented

This site includes **detailed documentation and beautiful examples** for each component — making it easy to explore or copy-paste what you need.

---

## ✨ Built with Purpose

This project reflects my love for UI, creativity, and learning. It's built for **reuse, inspiration**, and to **showcase my design perspective**.

You're welcome to explore and use anything freely — and if you find value in it, a small **attribution** [(Simple UI Components: suic-docs.vercel.app)](https://suic-docs.vercel.app) would mean a lot.

If you find value in this project, **star** it on [GitHub](https://github.com/vishnudt2004/suic-core/) and **share** it!
