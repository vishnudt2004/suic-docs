# Simple UI Components ‚Äì Core Documentation

## Introduction

**Simple UI Components** is a **personal, local-first collection of reusable UI and frontend utility components** ‚Äî installed locally as editable source code with minimal setup. Each component is **handcrafted from scratch**, reflecting my own ideas and needs while staying flexible enough to adapt to yours.

This is **not** a large, general-purpose UI library. Instead, it‚Äôs a **curated set of distinctive, editable components** designed for **direct integration into your projects** ‚Äî perfect for portfolio work, prototypes, or internal tools.

> **Note:**  
> Every component is built independently ‚Äî no direct copies from other libraries.

### Highlights & Principles

- **Not a full library ‚Äî a personal collection:** Made for my own projects, prototypes, and experiments; uniqueness over coverage.
- **Mix of UI & utility components:** Includes not just visual UI (buttons, tabs, callouts) but also functional/frontend helpers like `load-more-data`.
- **Install only what you need:** No single massive package ‚Äî add components individually via CLI.
- **Builder + Presets pattern:** Most component have a ‚Äúbuilder‚Äù (unstyled, functional foundation) and optional presets. Use presets or create your own design in minutes.
- **Fully customizable:** Most styles can be overridden via Tailwind class names, even deeply nested (e.g., `classNames.parent`, `classNames.child`, etc.).
- **Direct Tailwind integration:** Zero extra styling layers ‚Äî edit right in your Tailwind project.
- **Lightweight & minimal boilerplate:** Easy to fork into your own style or design system.
- **Variants & examples included:** Some components include multiple examples and variants to jump-start usage.

## Installation

```bash
suic-cli init
suic-cli add [components...]
```

<Callout title="Note">

**Inspired By:** The installation pattern in this project is inspired by [**shadcn/ui**](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli).

**Heads Up:** `suic-core` isn‚Äôt published as a package by design. It‚Äôs a personal collection of components. You can fork or clone the [repo](https://github.com/vishnudt2004/suic-core) from GitHub if you want to use it directly.

</Callout>

> For full CLI options and behavior, see the [CLI Documentation](/docs/cli).

## Usage

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export default function Example() {
  return <Button>Click Me</Button>;
}
```

> You can find **every component‚Äôs documentation** here: [All Components](/docs/components/).

Each page clearly explains installation, usage, customization, and includes **copy-paste-ready** snippets.

---

## Customization

- Built with Tailwind CSS ‚Äî override styles directly via `className`.
- Supports deep customization through structured `classNames` props (e.g., `classNames.parent`, `classNames.child`).
- Many components also provide customization-specific props (e.g., `accentColor`, `decorationElements`).

Example:

```tsx
<Button className="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600">Delete</Button>
```

or

```tsx
<Button classNames={{ parent: "bg-blue-500", child: "text-white" }}>
  Save
</Button>
```

## Extra Notes

- **Builder components:** Headless + Tailwind-ready foundations for full control over style.
- **Presets:** Pre-styled versions you can use instantly or modify.
- **Some components are utilities:** e.g., data loaders, layout helpers ‚Äî not just UI elements.
- **Some may have multiple variants/examples** ready to use.
- **This is a personal, evolving project** ‚Äî components may change or improve over time.
